# Predator v. Prey 
==================================================================
This is my predator vs. prey game! When I first started to think about what I should do for the game, I wanted to do something that would simulate interstellar traveling. You are the randomly colored quadrilateral and your objective is to catch the pulsating circle. Every time you “catch” or collide with the prey, you get a point. If at any point you want to reset the game, simply press the “r” key.

You can control your predator using your UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys.
